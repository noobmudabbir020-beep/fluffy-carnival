Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think and learn. Machine learning, a subset of AI, enables systems to improve their performance over time without explicit programming. Natural Language Processing (NLP) allows computers to understand and generate human language, while computer vision helps machines interpret visual data. Streamlit is a Python library that makes it easy to build interactive web applications for data science and AI projects. Groq provides ultra-fast inference for large language models such as LLaMA and Mixtral, while HuggingFace hosts thousands of pre-trained models that can be used for embeddings, classification, summarization, and more.
